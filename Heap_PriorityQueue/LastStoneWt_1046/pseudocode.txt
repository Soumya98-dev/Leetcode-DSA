#Pseudocode for Last Stone Weight
1. Max-heapify the array(negate stones to simulate max-heap in a min-heap library)
2. While heap has at least 2 stones
    1. Pop two largest stones; assign larger to y smaller to x
    2. Check if x == y : continue to next iteration
    3. Check if x != y : compute y - x and push result back into the heap
3. Return remaining stone in heap or 0 if empty
